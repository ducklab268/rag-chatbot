      "title": "Energy Mastery â€” what it means",
      "text": "Energy mastery is about managing mental, physical and emotional energy instead of time. High performers build routines, prioritize sleep, nutrition, focused work blocks, and deliberate recovery. The idea is to maintain consistent energy across the day, using rituals to enter focused states and micro-recoveries for restoration."

    {
      "title": "Avoiding Burnout",
      "text": "Preventing burnout requires boundaries, clear priorities, saying no to low-value work, and strong rest practices. High performers schedule rest like appointments, do weekly reviews, and reduce decision fatigue by simplifying routines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus and Flow",
      "text": "Flow is achieved by matching task challenge to skill level, removing distractions, and using short focused intervals (e.g., Pomodoro). Minimizing interruptions and batching similar tasks increases deep work periods."

      "title": "Recovery Techniques",
      "text": "Short naps, breathwork, movement breaks, and digital detoxes enhance recovery. High performers treat recovery as part of productivity, not optional."
